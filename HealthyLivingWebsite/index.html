<h2>What it means to be healthy</h2>
<p>Many factors affect your health. Some you cannot control, such as your genetic makeup or your age. But you can make changes to your lifestyle. Leading a physically and mentally well-balanced existence is the ideal way to live a healthy lifestyle. This is, of course, easier said than done, and there are a great many other things involved - the way you think, what you eat, where you work, where you live, what you do, what your financial situation is, who you know, and so on. You need a certain amount of self-discipline and self-motivation to maintain a sensible daily rhythm. You need to discover what works for you and what doesn't. You need to accept that certain things are beyond your control and there is little point in knocking yourself out about them. You need to understand that leading a healthy lifestyle is a continual and lifelong process. Life is a chain of continued efforts, an ongoing process. Think of yourself as a work of art in progress. </p>
<p> 
It's never too late to change your habits, and by establishing a healthy lifestyle now, you'll continue to reap the rewards in the future. Discover the facts behind nutrition so you can make informed choices, understand how BMI, or body mass index, affects you, or take part in our six-week diet and exercise programme. You don't have to slog it out in a sweaty gym to maintain a 'keep fit' lifestyle. Simply boosting your levels of general daily activity can massively improve your health and energy.

<h2>Keeping fit</h2>
<p>First things first, you don't have to join a gym. Getting fit is so much easier (and cheaper) than that.</p>
<p>Just walking at a decent pace for half an hour, five days a week, will do wonders for your health and fitness. 3 lots of 10 minutes work just as well and make it easier to fit into everyday life. Eating well and exercising regularly can make you feel better, more confident, happier, less stressed, sleep better and be more energised. For a step by step self-help guide, relaxation exercises and signposts to a variety of other services, visit our Wellbeing Steps for Stress website. </p>
<p>Not only that, there is strong scientific evidence that physical activity and a healthier diet can protect against many of Scotland's leading chronic diseases including heart disease, diabetes and some cancers.

<h2>Exercising</h2>
<p>There are all kinds of reasons why many of us find it hard to start exercising - our day-to-day lives require a lot less physical activity than in our grandparents' or even parents' day, most of us own cars and rely on them to get around, and more and more people spend hours sitting in front of computers.The pressures of home and family life can also mean it feels as if there's little time left to fit in exercise. It's certainly tough to get started. So, it's worth thinking about what you gain from regular exercise and making even a partial improvement to your fitness.
