Men's Rowing
The highest performance level for men’s rowing is Henley Royal Regatta and trialing for the Great Britain rowing team for Olympic Games and World Championships.  However, the heart and bulk of the men’s squad at London Rowing Club are not full-time internationals but people trying to enjoy competitive rowing while balancing their family, work and/or education commitments. They'd love to have you contribute alongside them in their passion for the beautiful sport of rowing. Our coaches can provide you with whatever you should want to enjoy your rowing; whether it’s a training program, technical advice, a calendar of racing or a fair chance at selection for the racing crews.
