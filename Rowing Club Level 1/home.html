London Rowing Club made its debut on the bosom of old Father Thames on the evening of Thursday 22 May 1856. This bald, proud birth announcement followed a six week pregnancy after conception at a meeting at the Craven Hotel, Strand, where those summoned by a circular letter from Josias Nottidge resolved to ‘form themselves into an association to be called the London Rowing Club, having for its object the encouragement of rowing on the River Thames, and the bringing together of gentlemen interested in that sport.’
London Rowing Club (LRC) focuses on producing crews to win events at Henley Royal Regatta and helping rowers to get selected for the Great Britain rowing team and race at the Olympic games and World Championships.
While London is a High Performance Centre for lightweight rowing, and has been the base for many successful international Lightweights since the inception of the weight class, we pride ourselves on helping anyone with any level of experience to embrace ambition, bring focus and commitment and we can help make your rowing aspirations come true. With a tremendous fleet of boats and professional coaching, coupled with a strong club spirit, we aim to be the club of choice for all athletes whether working part-time or full-time.
