Recreational Rowing & Explore Rowing
There is a strong social aspect to the happy boaters. It is normal to meet up for a drink and a chat after an outing and on the first Wednesday of the month a dinner is held at the Club.
We are also enthusiastic rowing tourists, meet up with other English Clubs and row different bits of river. We also go abroad and in recent time have visited Venice for the Vogalonga, Berlin, Madrid, Paris and Holland.
Those joining us have some previous rowing experience, but we will shortly be running a “Learn to Row” course, which will provide an entrance for those with no rowing experience.
