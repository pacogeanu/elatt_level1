Women's Rowing
LRC has a small, predominantly lightweight, women’s squad that is focussed on developing athletes to perform at the highest level of the sport; principally trialling for the GB team, aiming to win at Women’s Henley and the National Championships and race at Henley Royal Regatta. Under the guidance of Phil Bourguignon, LRC senior coach, the group trains in small boats for the majority of the year, mostly single and double sculls, with crew sculling boats formed for the main head races in the winter season. Off the water, the squad train alongside the men’s squad in the gym and on the erg, completing 10 – 12 sessions a week.
